This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: How Hard is it to read Philosophy?: A Brief Analysis of the Readability of 59 Philosophy Texts
+ This project is conducted by Guosheng Cai

+ Project summary: In this project, I want to explore the question: how hard is philosophy? Specifically, what is the difficulty to read philosophy texts. While readability is not the only element determining the complexity of learning a subject, it is an important factor impact factors such as what level of education is needed in order to study the subject and whether ordinary people would be interested in learning the subject. In additional providing information on the question, another objective of this analysis is to provide information for those who are scared of reading philosophy texts because of the public's perception on the difficulty of reading philosophy. I want use this analysis to provide some insights on what are the texts that are potentially easier to read for beginners in philosophy.
